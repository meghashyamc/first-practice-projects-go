This is the latest (as on October 2, 2019) version of the employee API that helps you add, delete, remove and list employee data.

Some new additions include: use of go routines (for faster concurrent processing), addition of a timestamp to show when an employee was added, displaying lists of employees based on timestamp, better error handling and more responsiveness.
